# Big Five Personality Prediction

This project fine-tunes "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest" to predict Big Five personality traits using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and PEFT toaccurately assess the Big Five personality traits from given text or sentences. By meticulously fine-tuning this model using a specially curated dataset tailored for personality traits, the model has learned to correlate specific textual inputs with distinct personality characteristics. This targeted approach has significantly improved the model's precision in identifying the Big Five personality traits, outperforming other models that were developed or fine-tuned on more generalized datasets.
